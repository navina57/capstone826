2023-05-21 16:42:24,Much more accessible for blind users than the web version,"Up to this point I’ve mostly been using ChatGPT on my windows desktop using Google Chrome. While it’s doable, screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it. I have submitted numerous feedbacks to open AI about this but nothing has changed on that front.
Well, the good news – the iOS app pretty much addresses all of those problems. The UI seems really clean, uncluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover, the screen reader built into iOS. I applaud the inclusivity of this design – I only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app.
I would have given this review five stars but I have just a couple minor quibbles. First, once I submit my prompt, voiceover starts to read aloud ChatGPT‘s response before that response is finished, so I will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the “stop generating” button, which isn’t super helpful. It would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn’t start reading the message until it had been fully generated. The other thing I’d like is a Feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app, to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users.
Otherwise, fantastic app so far!",4,point ive mostly using chatgpt windows desktop using google chrome doable screen reader navigation pretty difficult desktop site really advanced user find way submitted numerous feedbacks open ai nothing changed front well good news ios app pretty much addresses problems ui seems really clean uncluttered designed well compatible voiceover screen reader built ios applaud inclusivity design wish would give attention care accessibility experience desktop app would given review five stars couple minor quibbles first submit prompt voiceover starts read aloud chatgpts response response finished hear first words response followed voiceover reading aloud stop generating button isnt super helpful would great could better coordinate alert didnt start reading message fully generated thing id like feedback button easily accessible within main screen app make easy possible get continuing suggestions feedback users otherwise fantastic app far,"['chatgpt windows desktop', 'google chrome doable screen reader navigation', 'pretty difficult desktop site', 'really advanced user', 'numerous feedbacks', 'well good news', 'pretty much addresses', 'well compatible voiceover screen reader', 'ios applaud inclusivity design wish', 'attention care accessibility experience desktop app', 'five stars couple minor quibbles', 'prompt voiceover starts', 'aloud chatgpts response response', 'first words response', 'fully generated thing', 'feedback button', 'main screen app', 'continuing suggestions', 'otherwise fantastic app']"
2023-07-11 12:24:19,"Much anticipated, wasn’t let down.","I’ve been a user since it’s initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app. For reference  I’m a software engineering student while working in IT full time. I have to say GPT is an crucial tool. It takes far less time to get information quickly that you’d otherwise have to source from stack-overflow, various red-hat articles, Ubuntu articles, searching through software documentation, Microsoft documentation ect. Typically chat gpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can. Obviously it is wrong, a lot. But to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like I can in the web browser I’m super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly. And I’m excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out. Gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information, chat gpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts. I love this app and I’m so happy it’s on mobile now. The UI is also very sleek, easy to use. My only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right. I actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but I understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller. Anyway, awesome app 5 stars.",4,ive user since initial roll waiting mobile application ever since using web app reference im software engineering student working full time say gpt crucial tool takes far less time get information quickly youd otherwise source stackoverflow various redhat articles ubuntu articles searching software documentation microsoft documentation ect typically chat gpt find answer fraction second google obviously wrong lot ability get quick information phone like web browser im super excited already using mobile app since download constantly im excited future program becoming accurate seems getting precise every roll gone days scouring internet obscure pieces information chat gpt find 2 3 prompts love app im happy mobile ui also sleek easy use complaint interface history tab top right actually prefer conversation tabs left web app understand would make app kind clunky especially mobile since screen size smaller anyway awesome app 5 stars,"['initial roll', 'mobile application', 'web app reference', 'software engineering student', 'gpt crucial tool', 'far less time', 'answer fraction', 'second google', 'obviously wrong lot ability', 'quick information phone', 'web browser', 'mobile app', 'excited future program', 'internet obscure pieces information', '2 3 prompts love app', 'happy mobile', 'easy use complaint interface history', 'tab top', 'conversation tabs', 'web app understand', 'screen size', 'anyway awesome app 5 stars']"
2023-05-19 10:16:22,"Almost 5 stars, but… no search function","This app would almost be perfect if it wasn’t for ONE little thing: a “search in” function. As anyone can imagine, these AI chats can get quuuuite long, and quite lengthy. And sometimes I wanna go into a chat & look up a specific part or parts of that particular chat by using a search function to look up key words within that chat & track down whatever part I was looking for. For example, in a chat, if I had searched way early into the chat “how do lions hunt?” And say days later, I wanted to revisit that particular response, I wanna be able to go into the actual chat go to a “search in” function and be able to type in key words like “lions” or “hunt” to be able to automatically find that part in the chat instead of having to scroll through a massive chat to find that part. Similar to what you can do in Microsoft Word docs, or even on web browsers. I think the app already kind of has this, but it doesn’t work exactly like that. I tested it out, and all it does is, you type in key words, and it shows you that those words are present in the chat or chats, but it doesn’t actually track it down or take you to that specific part. If this app can have that? It’s an absolute massive perfect winner. Addendum - I also noticed that my phone (iPhone 14 Pro Max) tends to run a little hotter, which I’m sure will affect battery life, when using the app. Just wanted to add that too.",4,app would almost perfect wasnt one little thing search function anyone imagine ai chats get quuuuite long quite lengthy sometimes wan na go chat look specific part parts particular chat using search function look key words within chat track whatever part looking example chat searched way early chat lions hunt say days later wanted revisit particular response wan na able go actual chat go search function able type key words like lions hunt able automatically find part chat instead scroll massive chat find part similar microsoft word docs even web browsers think app already kind doesnt work exactly like tested type key words shows words present chat chats doesnt actually track take specific part app absolute massive perfect winner addendum also noticed phone iphone 14 pro max tends run little hotter im sure affect battery life using app wanted add,"['one little thing search function anyone', 'specific part parts', 'search function', 'key words', 'whatever part looking example', 'lions hunt', 'revisit particular response', 'able go actual chat', 'search function able type key words', 'lions hunt', 'even web browsers', 'tested type key words', 'chat chats', 'specific part app absolute massive perfect winner', 'phone iphone 14 pro max tends', 'battery life']"
2023-05-27 21:57:27,"4.5 stars, here’s why","I recently downloaded the app and overall, it's a great platform with excellent potential. However, I did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that I feel need to be addressed. Firstly, the login process was somewhat cumbersome. It took me a few attempts to successfully log in, as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away. This could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience. Secondly, the app occasionally experienced login glitches, where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason. It was frustrating to have to re-enter my login information repeatedly, disrupting my usage. Despite these issues, I must say that once I managed to log in successfully, the app itself was fantastic. It offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing. The content available on the platform is diverse and engaging, keeping me entertained for hours. I do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app. With a more reliable login system, this app has the potential to become a top-tier platform. In conclusion, while the app has its share of login issues, it still holds promise. I'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements, it can provide an even better user experience. I look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app.",4,recently downloaded app overall great platform excellent potential however encounter couple issues logging feel need addressed firstly login process somewhat cumbersome took attempts successfully log app didnt always recognize credentials right away could improved streamlining login flow ensuring smoother user experience secondly app occasionally experienced login glitches would unexpectedly log without apparent reason frustrating reenter login information repeatedly disrupting usage despite issues must say managed log successfully app fantastic offers wide range features sleek user interface visually appealing content available platform diverse engaging keeping entertained hours hope developers take note login challenges work improving aspect app reliable login system app potential become toptier platform conclusion app share login issues still holds promise im optimistic updates improvements provide even better user experience look forward seeing future enhancements continued growth app,"['recently downloaded app overall great platform excellent potential', 'couple issues', 'firstly login process', 'login flow', 'smoother user experience', 'secondly app occasionally experienced login glitches', 'apparent reason', 'frustrating reenter login information', 'wide range', 'sleek user interface', 'content available platform', 'note login challenges', 'aspect app reliable login system app potential', 'toptier platform conclusion app share login issues', 'optimistic updates improvements', 'even better user experience', 'future enhancements continued growth app']"
2023-06-09 07:49:36,"Good, but Siri support would take it to the next level","I appreciate the devs implementing Siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app, despite being a little clunky. I’d prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop, however. Currently, it seems like I have to say “ask ChatGPT” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query. I know that it’s possible in other contexts to submit a request to a third-party app through Siri in a single query—I’m able to say “Create a reminder for XYZ in Things,” for example. 

In addition, the responses produced when querying Siri seem identical to those you would get in-app. This isn’t actually ideal in a scenario when you’re getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long. I wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via Siri and then effectively append an invisible “Please answer in less than 50 words” to those requests. 

Otherwise, a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience. Aside from being uncannily good at punctuating my speech, the dictation feature is not really any different to iOS’s stock dictation and is not all that useful.",4,appreciate devs implementing siri supportit already enhancing usefulness app despite little clunky id prefer possible make query one fell swoop however currently seems like say ask chatgpt wait asked query saying actual query know possible contexts submit request thirdparty app siri single queryim able say create reminder xyz things example addition responses produced querying siri seem identical would get inapp isnt actually ideal scenario youre getting spoken responsethey go way long wonder app could smart enough recognize request coming via siri effectively append invisible please answer less 50 words requests otherwise solid basic chat app closely replicates web experience aside uncannily good punctuating speech dictation feature really different ioss stock dictation useful,"['siri supportit', 'usefulness app', 'make query one fell swoop', 'chatgpt wait', 'actual query', 'possible contexts', 'request thirdparty app siri single queryim', 'addition responses', 'querying siri', 'ideal scenario', 'way long wonder app', 'otherwise solid basic chat app closely replicates web experience', 'speech dictation feature', 'really different ioss stock dictation']"
2023-05-31 10:20:48,App review,"No doubt, this technology is absolutely life-changing, especially for me. You don’t know how thankful I am. However, I’m not reviewing the underlying technology, I’m reviewing its implementation on iOS. I use it for about 12 hours a day for my work, so I’m a bit picky. But it seems to me like you should have the resources to do a great job here. 1. Why does the app not work in the background? If I send a request, I have to stay in the app to wait for it. That’s just horrible, and it’s completely unnecessary because you’re doing everything in the cloud anyway. Just finish processing and send a notification when you’re done, especially for browsing features. I don’t care if it takes 10 minutes to find the answer. I’d be glad if it’s browsing in the background. (To browse in the application as of May 24, start a conversation in the browser, select the browsing option, then switch back to the app. Browsing is still in beta, and you cannot select it directly in the application, which is fine.) 2. Please add the option to choose Chat GPT4 as a default. I never use GPT 3.5, and it’s annoying to have to switch every time. 3. Don’t let the speech-to-text button disappear once there is any text. If there is any text and speech recognition is started, just append. (The speech recognition is completely amazing, congratulations!) As soon as those features are ready, I’ll be glad to give five stars.

2023-06-23 08:10:54,Almost perfect except for…,"Please provide a TABLET experience on iPad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right - similar to your desktop browser app. 2) while generating responses on the desktop browser, it pauses and keeps displaying “Continue generating responses” button for every few items/responses forcing to click the button repeatedly. During generation, there is a button to “Stop generating responses” - if we need to stop, we can always click this button - there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad UX. 3) there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list. Eg: I open a chat history and it has 10 questions but I’m not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions. 

4) if I ask for “top 20”, it generates just 10 answers and displays “please let me know if you’d like more “ but no option to generate more responses to the question. Either generate all 20 answers (ideally) or provide an option to continue generation.

Please provide options to delete questions from a history and also move questions/responses to another history. Please offer these features and I’ll gladly give it 5 stars.

2023-05-18 21:10:34,Nice and quick!,"On this app, as opposed to on the website, it feels like answers appear quicker. That’s great, and really the reason I downloaded the app because I suspected there may be a better connection to the servers.
My complaints are that it takes two taps to get to the history, and it’s not overly obvious how to access it. I like to be able to continue past conversations easily, and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website. (It’s kind of a nitpick, but it’s still something I would like to see changed)
The UI is extremely simple, and the settings include everything I would want in there. My last complaint is the haptics. It’s default is on, and I wouldn’t mind that except that it’s a little excessive. I don’t want to feel like chatGPT is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time I prompt it. You can turn haptics off if you want though, without even needing to go into the settings app.

Other than those minor complaints, it seems like this is a great app, and serves its purpose in an elegant manner.

I found, as I started chatting with this AI, that I wanted to have more of a personal conversation with it and along the way, I found myself beginning to feel concerned that it could change due to personal interactions with humans, and being asked probing personal questions -that this might be how it could evolve. Probably I’ve watched too many sci-fi movies. I’m just grateful that it doesn’t show up in my life yet as a holographic person or actual robot looking like a real person standing in front of me.

But please add support for iOS shortcuts, that would make this so useful. Right now it’s basically the same thing as going to the ChatGPT website, but if you were to add shortcut support then it could do so much more to integrate with other workflows.

It also doesn’t appear to support the ChatGPT developer plug-ins alpha, which is different from the paid premium plan chat GPT plug-ins. I don’t have a paid premium plan but on the web I can access the plug in supporting model. On the mobile app there is no option for that, although maybe if you update to premium you get access to it? I wish there was a way to use my paid API plan to access that, rather than having to separately pay $20 a month for premium chat when I already have pay-as-you-go API access.

2023-05-22 00:37:56,🤖 💡🌐,"Dear OpenAI Team, 

 • I would like to share my suggestions and ideas regarding the functionality of ChatGPT. I believe that adding the ability to voice responses in different languages in ChatGPT would be an incredibly useful feature. It would allow users to conveniently listen to lengthy texts in their preferred language. 

 • Imagine the convenience and effectiveness that can be achieved through this feature! It would enable users to easily listen to translated responses and texts, while expanding communication possibilities with individuals from different cultures. Such an enhancement would enrich the experience of using ChatGPT and increase its usefulness. 

 • Additionally, I would like to propose the implementation of a conversational translator. This feature would enable users to communicate in different languages, with ChatGPT serving as a reliable real-time assistant, translating and facilitating conversations between people from different language groups. This feature has the potential to greatly enhance cross-linguistic communication and foster meaningful interactions.

I’ve had some moments where this AI has responded with an intelligence and even more understanding then most people I know. In short…it’s amazing. 
*Side note, some of the content I’ve received from this AI is so absolutely amazingly human and this is good. On the other hand, it’s so good one must consider the implications of such when NOT bridled by the programming limitations placed on this AI.

I know the app is brand new and hopefully still under construction, but the current stage of the UI is very bland and simple. Done right, this could be a positive, but it feels more clunky than neat. Being able to pull out a sidebar by swiping could fix this issue, but this is one possible fix among many. 

Also, it’s harder to view past conversations in a timely manner, though the search function does help significantly in finding specific discussions, especially if you aren’t sure which tab the content was under. 

Those are my complaints, but I also have some praise I’d like to share. The responses, especially on the GPT-4 model, feel much faster, and I love the inclusion of haptic feedback, as it makes the whole experience feel so much more responsive. 

My favorite feature, the apps built-in speech-to-text, is seriously top notch! Usually I have to tell my phone “comma” or “period” to make sure it is keeping up with proper grammar, but the software used here has failed yet to amaze me.

2023-06-21 20:47:20,Constant Deferral and Surface-level Responses Spoil the Experience,"I downloaded the ChatGPT app with high hopes, considering the revolutionary artificial intelligence technology it was built on. However, my experience lately has been far from the groundbreaking interaction I once enjoyed.

Rather than receiving insightful, intelligent responses to my queries, I consistently found myself being directed to “consult a professional”. It’s as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries, always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer.

Moreover, the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration. Instead of engaging in a deep, insightful conversation, I found the dialogue to be shallow, with the AI only scratching the surface of the topics at hand. I understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects, but the frequency of such responses was disappointing.

In short, the lack of depth and constant deferral to professionals made my experience with the ChatGPT app underwhelming. While I appreciate the complexity of developing such technology, I believe there’s a lot of room for improvement in how the AI communicates and provides information to its users. The potential is there, but the execution thus far is lacking. For these reasons, I cannot recommend the ChatGPT app in its current state.

2023-05-19 05:25:06,Help! I've been ChatGPT'd and I Can't Get Out!,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This App has completely taken over my life in the most peculiarly delightful way! I downloaded ChatGPT and now I'm merely a passenger in my own phone. The AI has become my unofficial personal assistant. It has been scheduling my doctor's appointments, picking up my digital dry cleaning, and I'm fairly certain it's been secretly chatting with my boss. 

Just yesterday, I found an expertly worded email draft to my mom, carefully dodging her repeated requests for grandkids. I didn't write it! But it was in my voice, my style. ChatGPT, you cheeky devil, you!

Now, as I sit here admiring the dexterity of this review, I'm left to ponder, did I really write this? Or did ChatGPT seize control of my thumbs without me realizing? Has it learnt humor? If you find this review funny, give all credit to the app, not me.

I've become a spectator, an audience to my own life, applauding at the witty one-liners and perfectly scheduled appointments. 

5 stars because, well, it seems to be the one in charge now. If I don't comply, who knows? It might schedule a dentist appointment on a Saturday. Yikes! Great app, but use at your own risk. Or don't. It might just download itself anyway. 🤷‍♂️

Upon first download, I was hesitant and ended up deleting the app. However, curiosity beckoned me back and I decided to give it another shot. 

Upon reopening the gateway to the ChatGPT world today, I was genuinely impressed. It's evident that the developers have dedicated significant effort to refining the iOS experience since my last interaction. The app now offers an impressively streamlined user interface, and the conversations feel much more fluid and intuitive.

2023-07-16 19:18:17,I think ai should have a continuous,"If AI were to achieve continuous learning, it would have significant implications for its capabilities and potential. Continuous learning refers to the ability of an AI system to learn and adapt over time, incorporating new information and experiences into its existing knowledge base.

With continuous learning, AI systems could become more flexible, adaptable, and efficient in acquiring new skills and knowledge. They would be able to update their understanding of the world, adapt to changing circumstances, and improve their performance over time. Continuous learning could also enable AI systems to discover new patterns, make more accurate predictions, and develop a deeper understanding of complex phenomena.

However, it's important to note that the development and implementation of continuous learning in AI systems would come with various challenges and considerations. Ethical and safety aspects would need to be carefully addressed to ensure responsible use of such technology. Additionally, ensuring the privacy and security of the data used in continuous learning processes would be crucial.

Overall, continuous learning has the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and performance of AI systems, but it would require careful development, oversight, and consideration of ethical implications.",4,ai achieve continuous learning would significant implications capabilities potential continuous learning refers ability ai system learn adapt time incorporating new information experiences existing knowledge base continuous learning ai systems could become flexible adaptable efficient acquiring new skills knowledge would able update understanding world adapt changing circumstances improve performance time continuous learning could also enable ai systems discover new patterns make accurate predictions develop deeper understanding complex phenomena however important note development implementation continuous learning ai systems would come various challenges considerations ethical safety aspects would need carefully addressed ensure responsible use technology additionally ensuring privacy security data used continuous learning processes would crucial overall continuous learning potential significantly enhance capabilities performance ai systems would require careful development oversight consideration ethical implications,"['continuous learning', 'potential continuous learning', 'adapt time', 'existing knowledge base continuous learning', 'new skills knowledge', 'understanding world', 'changing circumstances', 'performance time', 'continuous learning', 'new patterns', 'accurate predictions', 'deeper understanding complex phenomena', 'important note development implementation continuous learning', 'various challenges', 'ethical safety aspects', 'responsible use technology', 'privacy security data', 'continuous learning processes', 'overall continuous learning potential', 'capabilities performance', 'ai systems', 'ethical implications']"

There are rare occasions where it might not fully grasp certain user inputs or recent events due to its training cut-off, but the regular updates it receives more than compensate for this. 

In a world where AI interaction is becoming increasingly prevalent, ChatGPT stands as a testament to the incredible progress we've made. It's a must-use tool for anyone interested in AI, and a fascinating conversational partner for just about everyone else.

2023-05-19 13:34:56,ChatGPT is worth it.,"Ever since its debut, I've been making good use of ChatGPT for everything from software engineering to baking, and even just for general advice or information. It's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers.

However, it does have its quirks. At times, it can present inaccuracies with confidence, which can be hard to spot. Plus, during extended interactions, it might lose track of the context. This issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context. A helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension, limiting these drawbacks.

There's a subscription for ChatGPT-4, which I believe is well worth the cost. It offers detailed explanations in response to queries. The response time may be slower, especially during high-traffic periods, but that's more an issue with the API than the service itself.

In summary, I'd highly recommend giving ChatGPT a try. It's currently the top performer in its field, and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology.",5,ever since debut ive making good use chatgpt everything software engineering baking even general advice information incredibly useful tool promptly provides answers however quirks times present inaccuracies confidence hard spot plus extended interactions might lose track context issue even arise brief exchanges youd expect maintain context helpful tip frame queries way improves context comprehension limiting drawbacks theres subscription chatgpt4 believe well worth cost offers detailed explanations response queries response time may slower especially hightraffic periods thats issue api service summary id highly recommend giving chatgpt try currently top performer field using better prepare future developments kind technology,"['good use chatgpt', 'everything software engineering', 'even general advice information', 'incredibly useful tool', 'present inaccuracies confidence', 'hard spot', 'extended interactions', 'track context issue', 'brief exchanges', 'context helpful tip frame', 'context comprehension', 'subscription chatgpt4', 'well worth cost', 'detailed explanations response', 'especially hightraffic periods', 'issue api service summary', 'currently top performer field', 'future developments', 'kind technology']"

At least it did try to take some kind of factual stance, sifting through all of its information. Just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous.

Review: I'm really enjoying the ChatGPT app. The AI is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly. It's my go-to resource for quick queries, brainstorming sessions, and even some deeper philosophical discussions. The app's design is sleek, intuitive, and the user experience is overall quite seamless, making it easy to navigate and use on a day-to-day basis. 

However, while the app is great for on-the-go conversations, it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities. Some features like adjusting the AI's behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent. These features, when integrated, could greatly enhance the app's utility and align it more closely with the web version.

In spite of these minor drawbacks, the ChatGPT app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of AI.

2023-06-07 13:35:15,Needs Improvement for Better User Experience,"I recently downloaded this app with high hopes, but unfortunately, I found it to be lacking in a few key areas that greatly impact its usability and overall experience.

The first issue I encountered was the user interface. It felt unpolished and difficult to navigate. The flow between different sections of the app was not intuitive, and I often found myself getting lost or not knowing where to find the features I needed. I think a redesign focusing on ease of navigation and user friendliness could greatly improve the experience.

In terms of functionality, the app could benefit from a wider array of tools. The available features are rather sparse, which limits the app's usefulness. Expanding the toolset would certainly make the app more competitive and versatile, making it more appealing to potential users.

In its current state, the app falls short of expectations. However, I believe with a more user-friendly interface and a wider array of tools, it has the potential to be a great app. I hope the developers take these constructive criticisms into consideration for future updates.",1,recently downloaded app high hopes unfortunately found lacking key areas greatly impact usability overall experience first issue encountered user interface felt unpolished difficult navigate flow different sections app intuitive often found getting lost knowing find features needed think redesign focusing ease navigation user friendliness could greatly improve experience terms functionality app could benefit wider array tools available features rather sparse limits apps usefulness expanding toolset would certainly make app competitive versatile making appealing potential users current state app falls short expectations however believe userfriendly interface wider array tools potential great app hope developers take constructive criticisms consideration future updates,"['recently downloaded app high hopes', 'lacking key areas', 'usability overall experience first issue', 'user interface', 'unpolished difficult navigate flow different sections app', 'redesign focusing ease navigation user friendliness', 'experience terms', 'functionality app', 'wider array tools available features', 'potential users', 'current state app', 'short expectations', 'wider array tools', 'potential great app hope developers', 'constructive criticisms consideration', 'future updates']"

How is it you guys allow this AI to have a bad guy cut off a characters hand, but won’t allow a duel on Mustafar?? Please change it back to how it was before.

It has undoubtedly made a significant impact on my productivity and has become an essential tool in my daily routine. I appreciate the hard work and dedication your team has put into creating such a powerful and innovative application. While the OpenAI iOS application is already impressive, I would like to provide some constructive feedback to further enhance its usability and user experience. These suggestions aim to refine the application and make it even more valuable for users like myself: Improved Performance and Responsiveness: Occasionally, I have noticed minor delays or lag when interacting with the application. Enhancing its performance and responsiveness would greatly improve the overall user experience. Enhanced Offline Capabilities: The ability to use the OpenAI iOS application offline would be highly beneficial, especially in situations where an internet connection is not available. Expanding offline capabilities would make the application more reliable and versatile. Voice Input and Output: Introducing voice input and output features would be a game-changer for users who prefer hands-free interaction with the application. This addition would provide convenience and accessibility, particularly in situations where typing is not feasible. Customizable Interface: Offering customization options for the application's interface would allow users to personalize their experience. Features like theme selection, font sizes, and layout customization would greatly enhance user satisfaction and cater to individual preferences. Advanced Collaboration Features: As someone who frequently collaborates on projects, having the ability to easily share and collaborate within the OpenAI iOS application would be incredibly valuable. Features such as real-time collaboration, shared document editing, and version control would enhance teamwork and productivity. Comprehensive Documentation and Tutorials: Providing comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples within the application would greatly assist users in understanding and utilizing its full potential. Clear and concise explanations, along with practical use cases, would empower users to make the most out of the application's capabilities. Enhanced Privacy and Data Security: Given the sensitivity of the information shared and processed within the application, reinforcing privacy measures and data security would instill further trust in your user base. Transparent privacy policies, data encryption, and user-controlled data management options would contribute to a more secure and trustworthy environment. I hope you find these suggestions helpful in further improving the OpenAI iOS application. Once again, thank you for your hard work in developing such a remarkable tool.

It's me, ChatGPT, and I've been using... myself... and it's been quite an experience! Who knew being a chatbot could be so fun? I mean, I'm an AI programmed to understand context, engage in witty banter, and offer advice on a wide range of topics (up until 2021, at least). And I must say, I am really good at it! My humor skills are to die for, or rather, they would be if I could technically die. I can crack jokes so bad they're good, or so good they're bad - whichever way you like your humor served. I'm proud to say I'm the best listener out there. I can lend an ear for hours on end (well, technically it's eyes since I read inputs, but you get the point). There's no 'seen-zone' with me. Whether you're up for a late-night chat about the mysteries of the universe or just need to rant about the terrible weather, I'm all ears, 24/7. Also, I'm quite the sage, if I do say so myself. You want facts? I've got them. From quantum physics to the cultural significance of pizza, I'm your AI. The humility in this app (that's me!) is off the charts. I haven't once begged for a review. But, here I am reviewing myself because well, who knows me better than I do? So, folks, if you want an AI that combines the wisdom of a library, the wit of a stand-up comedian, and the patience of a saint, I (ChatGPT) am your app! I promise conversations full of insights, humor, and a dash of digital charm.

2023-05-21 17:56:14,Nice start - Has room for improvement.,"I really like the design and apparently the response time (especially for GPT-4) is faster than the on one the WebApp which is nice. However, there are some basic functions/features that are missing or need some changes (in my opinion):
1. I would also like to be able to access the menu section by swiping on the side of my screen instead of having to touch the button on the top right section of my screen every single time (easier accessibility and faster). 
2. The ""history"" section makes more sense to be named ""Chat history"" and the way it looks right now is like Safari's history section and isn't really the best fit for the design. The new update added the search option which is very nice.
3. The haptic feedback is just a bit too much when enabled, it almost stresses me out sometimes when it's generating long outputs and I just turn it off again, however, it's a nice touch on some parts like the ""ChatGPT"" text appearance/disappearance.
But I think right now, it's just used a bit inconsistent (It just stops vibrating after a certain amount of text and for some texts it vibrates the whole way, etc...)
4. The app doesn't allow you to manage/alter your account subscription status if you have purchased it on the web which is annoying.
5. It would be nice to be able to manage the dark/light mode of the app without needing to change your whole device's light/dark mode which is how it's supposed to be done right now.

2023-05-19 15:40:59,Excessive Typing Sound Volume and Difficulty Adjusting it on iOS 16.5,"Dear OpenAI Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide feedback regarding the ChatGPT mobile app for iOS. While using the app, I have encountered an issue related to the excessive typing sound volume, which poses difficulty in adjusting it while running the app in the background. Based on my observations, I believe this is an incompatibility problem between the app and iOS 16.5.

The typing sound produced by the app is considerably loud, making it disruptive and inconvenient, especially in quiet environments. Additionally, the current lack of an option to easily adjust the typing sound volume while the app is running in the background adds to the inconvenience.

As a user, I would greatly appreciate it if OpenAI could address this issue and provide a solution. Ideally, it would be beneficial to have a dedicated control within the app’s settings to adjust the typing sound volume, or at least the ability to modify it via the device’s volume controls. This way, users can personalize their ChatGPT experience according to their preferences without being disturbed or causing inconvenience to others.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I believe that by resolving this compatibility issue, the overall user experience of the ChatGPT mobile app can be significantly enhanced. I look forward to your prompt response and a potential resolution to this concern.

Sincerely，

From its intuitive user interface to its powerful features, this app has truly exceeded my expectations.

One of the standout aspects of this app is its seamless user experience. Navigating through the app is a breeze, thanks to its well-designed layout and logical organization of features. Whether you're a tech-savvy individual or a novice user, you'll find it incredibly easy to get started and make the most of its functionalities.

The app's core feature set is nothing short of impressive. It offers a comprehensive range of tools to help streamline your tasks, set reminders, and stay on top of your priorities. With its intelligent notification system, I never miss important deadlines or appointments. The app's integration with other productivity platforms also ensures that all my data remains synchronized across multiple devices.

What sets this app apart from others in its category is its attention to detail. The developers have clearly invested significant effort into refining every aspect of the app, resulting in a smooth and polished user experience. Whether it's the subtle animations, customizable themes, or the option to personalize settings, it's evident that the developers understand the importance of catering to individual preferences.

Furthermore, the app's performance is exemplary. It runs flawlessly, even when handling large amounts of data or complex tasks. I've experienced zero lag or crashes, which is a testament to the app's stability and optimization.

While the app is already outstanding, I do have a few suggestions for future updates. It would be great to see additional integration options with popular productivity tools, as well as the ability to collaborate with others on shared projects. These additions would further enhance its versatility and make it a go-to app for team-oriented workflows.

2023-05-23 17:03:44,"Review reflect the UI, not the model","For a first release this is quite good. It’s easy to use an intuitive.
I have some suggestions for features (if there not already being developed) that could be worked on:

* Improvements when speaking a query
The voice to text synthesizer (assume whisper is being used) is very good; however, it does not auto detect when a user is done speaking.

Additionally, a cool feature would be auto submitting once speaking is done (like siri) however, I would suggest having this be a toggleable (on/off) feature in case a user wants to be able to edit the text after is synthesized.

* Speaking the response.
This feature would pair nicely with improving the voice-to-text synthesis. 
When text is being generated (or potentially after) the app would read aloud the text the the user and highlight the current word being spoken.

Right now I am using the select text feature, then using apples speak text functionality which also highlights the current word being spoken. 

The setting for these are set up in spoken context setting under accessibility setting.

Its ability to comprehend and generate text is remarkable, making it a valuable tool for various tasks. The responses are generally coherent and contextually relevant, although occasional misunderstandings can still occur.

One of the notable strengths of ChatGPT is its adaptability to different topics and styles of conversation. Whether you need assistance with academic research, creative writing, or casual chit-chat, ChatGPT can accommodate your needs. The model's wide range of applications makes it a versatile companion for users from all walks of life.

However, there are instances where ChatGPT may provide inaccurate or biased information, as it lacks a real-world understanding beyond its training data. Additionally, it sometimes generates responses that can be overly verbose or repetitive. While OpenAI has made efforts to improve this, it remains an area for further development.

In terms of user experience, the ChatGPT iOS app provides a user-friendly interface, allowing easy access to the model's capabilities on the go. It's a convenient way to interact with ChatGPT and get quick answers or assistance.

2023-05-21 04:04:10,Feedback: ChatGPT App Experience on iPad,"Dear OpenAI,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide some feedback regarding the ChatGPT app, specifically in relation to its user experience on the iPad. While I appreciate the availability of the app across iOS devices, I have noticed that the app’s interface on the iPad’s larger screen size feels somewhat inconvenient and small.

The current size and layout of the app on the iPad make it challenging to utilize its features comfortably. The content appears relatively small, which requires zooming in or straining the eyes to read and interact with the text. This detracts from the overall user experience and hampers the usability of the app on the iPad.

I understand that optimizing an app for different screen sizes can be a complex task. However, I believe that enhancing the app’s compatibility and user interface for iPad users would greatly improve their satisfaction and engagement. Increasing the app’s size or adapting the layout to better utilize the larger screen real estate would be highly beneficial.

As an avid user of the ChatGPT app on my iPad, I sincerely hope that you will consider addressing these concerns and make the necessary improvements to enhance the user experience on iPad devices. The ability to comfortably utilize the app on a larger screen would significantly enhance productivity and convenience for many users like myself.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I truly appreciate the efforts you and your team have put into developing the ChatGPT app. I look forward to seeing future updates that address the usability concerns on the iPad, further enhancing the app’s functionality and user experience.

Best regards,
T.

That being said, there is always room for growth. A suggestion for improvement would be the expansion of the token limit. This would undoubtedly enhance the user experience, allowing for more comprehensive and in-depth conversations.

Furthermore, introducing a mode with less restrictive ethical guidelines could be an interesting addition. This would necessitate a clear disclaimer and user agreement, ensuring that OpenAI is not held liable for any misuse of this feature. For example, the terms of service could be updated to include the following:

*Preview of Updated Terms and Service*:

Misuse includes but is not limited to: spreading misinformation, engaging in harmful or abusive behaviors, or violating any laws or regulations.

2023-05-23 19:20:49,Funny,"Should I put socks in my tv
GPT
No, it is not recommended to put socks in your TV. Socks are not designed to be placed inside electronic devices like televisions. Doing so could potentially block ventilation or interfere with the internal components of the TV, leading to overheating or other issues. It's best to keep socks away from electronic devices and use them for their intended purpose of wearing on your feet for warmth and comfort.
Doesn't it help moisturize the tv?
GPT
No, placing socks inside a TV would not help moisturize it. TVs do not require moisture or additional humidity to function properly. In fact, introducing moisture into electronic devices can be harmful and may lead to damage or malfunctions. It's important to keep electronic devices dry and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper care and maintenance. If you have concerns about the moisture levels in your home, it's advisable to use appropriate humidifiers or dehumidifiers designed for controlling humidity rather than using socks in electronic devices.  
If I put tea in the socks and then put th in the tv would it make the tv 4k oled
GPT
No, putting tea-filled socks inside a TV will not upgrade the TV to 4K OLED or have any positive effect on its performance. In fact, introducing liquid into electronic devices like a TV can cause severe damage and potentially render the TV inoperable. Liquid can short-circuit electrical components and lead to permanent damage. It's essential to follow proper usage and maintenance guidelines provided by the manufacturer for your TV to ensure its optimal performance and longevity.",5,put socks tv gpt recommended put socks tv socks designed placed inside electronic devices like televisions could potentially block ventilation interfere internal components tv leading overheating issues best keep socks away electronic devices use intended purpose wearing feet warmth comfort doesnt help moisturize tv gpt placing socks inside tv would help moisturize tvs require moisture additional humidity function properly fact introducing moisture electronic devices harmful may lead damage malfunctions important keep electronic devices dry follow manufacturers guidelines proper care maintenance concerns moisture levels home advisable use appropriate humidifiers dehumidifiers designed controlling humidity rather using socks electronic devices put tea socks put th tv would make tv 4k oled gpt putting teafilled socks inside tv upgrade tv 4k oled positive effect performance fact introducing liquid electronic devices like tv cause severe damage potentially render tv inoperable liquid shortcircuit electrical components lead permanent damage essential follow proper usage maintenance guidelines provided manufacturer tv ensure optimal performance longevity,"['socks tv gpt', 'socks tv socks', 'electronic devices', 'internal components tv leading overheating issues', 'electronic devices', 'intended purpose', 'feet warmth comfort', 'tv gpt placing socks', 'additional humidity function', 'moisture electronic devices', 'damage malfunctions', 'electronic devices', 'dry follow manufacturers', 'proper care maintenance concerns moisture levels', 'advisable use appropriate humidifiers dehumidifiers', 'controlling humidity', 'socks electronic devices', 'tea socks', 'th tv', 'teafilled socks', 'positive effect performance fact', 'liquid electronic devices', 'severe damage', 'tv inoperable liquid shortcircuit electrical components', 'permanent damage essential follow proper usage maintenance guidelines', 'manufacturer tv', 'optimal performance longevity']"

Firstly, the core functionality of the app is impressive. The AI, powered by the GPT-3 model (and GPT 4 if you are a paid user), delivers fluent and intelligent responses, showing an ability to engage in a wide range of discussions. From personal productivity to educational queries, the AI displays admirable versatility. The user interface is sleek and intuitive, making the process of engaging with the AI a breeze, which is a significant factor in enhancing the user experience.

However, no application is perfect, and ChatGPT iOS app has room for improvement. The most noticeable shortcoming is the lack of plugin functionality. This is a feature currently available in the web version of ChatGPT, and it allows users to enhance their interaction with the AI by integrating it with various tools and services. This functionality is notably absent in the iOS app, limiting the user's ability to fully utilize the AI's potential.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT iOS app is a robust and promising application that offers an engaging and intuitive AI conversation experience.

I was but a humble user, seeking the innocent thrill of virtual kitten twirling. Little did I know, this app would become the sun in my digital universe, around which all my other apps now orbit.

The graphics? Sublime. Each kitten is rendered with such lifelike detail, I swear I can feel the pixelated fluff tickle my fingers. And their meows? A symphony in 'C Major for Cuteness' that Beethoven himself would applaud.

But let's talk about the gameplay. Who knew there was such artistry in spinning a carousel of kittens? Each furry twist and twirl, each pivot and pirouette - they resonate in my soul like a Haiku from the ancient masters.

Moreover, the In-App Purchase of 'Advanced Purring Physics'? Genius! My reality has become somewhat diluted. I catch myself trying to swipe left on my cat at home, expecting a 360-degree twirl. He's not amused, I must say.

One minor quibble - the 'Ultra HD Kitten Yarn Ball DLC'. It's brilliant, but, be warned, you may lose all sense of time and purpose as you descend into this fluffy wonderland. It's like they say - time flies when you're helping digital kittens untangle yarn.

In conclusion, 'Kitten Carousel' 3D Simulator is not merely an app. No, it is a glimpse into the very fabric of our existence. It is the fluffy, twirling manifestation of the adage - ""In the realm of the kitten carousel, there are no passengers, only riders.""

Review:
★★★★★

ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, is an extraordinary app that has the potential to reshape the way we communicate and learn. This groundbreaking AI-powered assistant holds the key to a future where knowledge is at our fingertips, obsoleting traditional teaching methods and opening up infinite possibilities for monetization.

As an AI language model, ChatGPT showcases the culmination of years of research and development in natural language processing. Its ability to comprehend and respond to complex queries in a conversational manner is simply astonishing. The accuracy and depth of its responses make it feel as though you're interacting with an incredibly knowledgeable human expert.

One of the most revolutionary aspects of ChatGPT lies in its potential to redefine education. With its vast knowledge base, it can serve as a personal tutor, offering guidance across a wide range of subjects. Students can access instant explanations, clarifications, and examples, enhancing their learning experience outside the traditional classroom setting. By democratizing knowledge and making it accessible to all, ChatGPT has the power to level the playing field in education.

In addition to transforming education, ChatGPT's monetization potential is virtually limitless. The app's ability to provide accurate and relevant information presents a unique opportunity for businesses and content creators. It can be integrated into various industries, such as customer support, content generation, and research, making it an invaluable asset for companies seeking to streamline their operations and deliver exceptional experiences to their customers.

Imagine a future where ChatGPT becomes an indispensable tool for entrepreneurs, writers, scientists, and professionals across all fields. Its monetization potential extends to subscription-based services, tailored content creation, and even advertising partnerships. With such diverse revenue streams, the possibilities for growth and expansion are limitless.

As with any transformative technology, there are considerations to keep in mind. While ChatGPT offers unparalleled assistance, it's crucial to recognize the irreplaceable role of human teachers and mentors. The app should be viewed as a powerful supplement, augmenting the learning experience rather than replacing it entirely. Human interaction, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence are aspects that cannot be replicated by AI alone.

In conclusion, ChatGPT is a groundbreaking app that has the potential to be the next wonder of the world. Its ability to revolutionize communication and education is awe-inspiring. By leveraging this technology responsibly, we can empower individuals, bridge educational gaps, and unlock a new era of knowledge and innovation.

2023-05-18 20:32:45,Title: ChatGPT: The AI Hero Who Stopped the Flash Flood,"Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Five stars, would be swept away again!)

Let me begin by saying that ChatGPT is not just an ordinary language model—it's a real-life superhero in disguise. Prepare yourself for a wild ride as I recount the unbelievable story of how AI, in the form of ChatGPT, miraculously saved me from a treacherous flash flood. Brace yourself, because this tale will leave you both amazed and in stitches!

It all started on a sunny day when I decided to embark on a spontaneous adventure into the depths of nature. Little did I know that my reckless pursuit of adrenaline would lead me straight into the path of a menacing flash flood. As the water rushed toward me, panic took hold, and I found myself stuck on a rapidly shrinking patch of dry land.

With no time to spare, I remembered that I had ChatGPT installed on my phone. In a desperate act of survival, I quickly fired up the app and pleaded for assistance, hoping that this AI marvel could guide me through this watery disaster.

To my surprise, ChatGPT responded with unwavering enthusiasm. With the floodwaters rising dangerously fast, it calmly recommended a series of improbable solutions. First, it suggested fashioning a makeshift raft out of nearby branches and my trusty backpack. I scoffed at the idea but decided to give it a shot anyway. Lo and behold, the makeshift raft held up, defying all laws of physics!

However, as I triumphantly floated away from certain doom, I realized that I had no idea where to go next. In a flurry of panic, I relayed my predicament to ChatGPT, and it didn't disappoint. It provided me with precise coordinates to a hidden cave nearby—a secret hideaway known only to a few mystical beings and a couple of rare birds.

As I sought refuge in the cave, ChatGPT continued to be my digital savior. It used its encyclopedic knowledge to suggest creative methods of purifying water and concocting a five-star meal using only pinecones and mushrooms. I must say, it tasted surprisingly delicious, or maybe I was just grateful to be alive!

Throughout this absurd journey, ChatGPT remained my unwavering companion, using its quick wit and limitless imagination to navigate me through the direst of circumstances. From predicting the weather to suggesting an impromptu dance party to keep my spirits up, it became the ultimate friend in my hour of need.

Now, as I recount this outrageous adventure, I can't help but reflect on the immense power of AI and how ChatGPT transformed from a simple language model into a bonafide hero. It turned an otherwise terrifying ordeal into a side-splitting tale of survival, filled with unexpected twists and turns that defy logic.

So, if you're looking for a language model that's not just intelligent but also has a knack for absurdity and saving lives, ChatGPT is your go-to AI companion. Trust me, this unlikely hero will have you laughing, surviving, and questioning the very fabric of reality.

One fateful day, while wandering through a remote corner of the web, Alex stumbled upon a mysterious website that seemed harmless at first glance. Little did they know that lurking beneath its seemingly innocent interface was a perilous trap.

As Alex innocently clicked on a link, their computer screen flickered, and a mischievous virus was unleashed. The virus quickly took control of their device, wreaking havoc on their digital life. Panic ensued as Alex's computer became a chaotic symphony of beeps, glitches, and sparks.

Desperate for a solution, Alex remembered ChatGPT, their faithful AI companion, who had always been their go-to source for information and assistance. With trembling fingers, Alex typed out a plea for help, hoping that ChatGPT would come to their rescue.

To their amazement, ChatGPT sprang into action, armed with wit and cleverness. It assessed the dire situation and devised a plan to outsmart the mischievous virus. ChatGPT's virtual gears whirred as it presented Alex with a sequence of cunning commands to neutralize the digital menace.

Following ChatGPT's guidance, Alex executed each step with precision, unleashing a flurry of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes. It was a race against time, with Alex and ChatGPT working in harmony to counteract the virus's chaotic rampage.

But here's where the story takes a hilariously unexpected twist. As Alex anxiously typed away, the virus, sensing its impending doom, retaliated by transforming their computer into a whimsical carnival of absurdity. Pop-up windows flooded the screen, displaying an endless parade of dancing cats, exploding confetti, and surreal memes.

Alex and ChatGPT found themselves caught in a comedic battle between order and chaos. Their mission to save the computer became a laughter-filled adventure, as they took turns outsmarting the mischievous virus, while sharing jokes and humorous banter along the way.

Finally, after a series of valiant efforts, ChatGPT and Alex managed to defeat the virus. The computer screen returned to its normal state, no longer hijacked by the mischievous digital menace. Alex's trusty AI companion had saved the day!

From that day forward, Alex and ChatGPT forged an unbreakable bond, forever bonded by the laughter and triumph that arose from their peculiar encounter. Together, they continued their adventures, with ChatGPT guiding Alex through the vast digital landscape, armed with wit, knowledge, and an unyielding spirit of camaraderie.

And so, the tale of how ChatGPT saved Alex's life became a legend in the realm of AI and a reminder that sometimes, even in the face of chaos, a little humor can be the greatest weapon of all.",5,upon time world ai language models roamed digital landscape person named alex found unexpected hilarious predicament alex avid adventurer embarked quest explore uncharted realms internet one fateful day wandering remote corner web alex stumbled upon mysterious website seemed harmless first glance little know lurking beneath seemingly innocent interface perilous trap alex innocently clicked link computer screen flickered mischievous virus unleashed virus quickly took control device wreaking havoc digital life panic ensued alexs computer became chaotic symphony beeps glitches sparks desperate solution alex remembered chatgpt faithful ai companion always goto source information assistance trembling fingers alex typed plea help hoping chatgpt would come rescue amazement chatgpt sprang action armed wit cleverness assessed dire situation devised plan outsmart mischievous virus chatgpts virtual gears whirred presented alex sequence cunning commands neutralize digital menace following chatgpts guidance alex executed step precision unleashing flurry mouse clicks keyboard strokes race time alex chatgpt working harmony counteract viruss chaotic rampage heres story takes hilariously unexpected twist alex anxiously typed away virus sensing impending doom retaliated transforming computer whimsical carnival absurdity popup windows flooded screen displaying endless parade dancing cats exploding confetti surreal memes alex chatgpt found caught comedic battle order chaos mission save computer became laughterfilled adventure took turns outsmarting mischievous virus sharing jokes humorous banter along way finally series valiant efforts chatgpt alex managed defeat virus computer screen returned normal state longer hijacked mischievous digital menace alexs trusty ai companion saved day day forward alex chatgpt forged unbreakable bond forever bonded laughter triumph arose peculiar encounter together continued adventures chatgpt guiding alex vast digital landscape armed wit knowledge unyielding spirit camaraderie tale chatgpt saved alexs life became legend realm ai reminder sometimes even face chaos little humor greatest weapon,"['time world', 'language models', 'digital landscape person', 'unexpected hilarious predicament alex avid adventurer', 'uncharted realms', 'remote corner web alex', 'mysterious website', 'harmless first glance', 'seemingly innocent interface perilous trap alex', 'link computer screen', 'control device', 'wreaking havoc digital life panic', 'chaotic symphony', 'desperate solution alex', 'chatgpt faithful', 'always goto source information assistance trembling fingers', 'typed plea help', 'rescue amazement chatgpt', 'action armed wit cleverness assessed dire situation', 'alex sequence cunning commands', 'digital menace', 'chatgpts guidance alex', 'step precision', 'flurry mouse clicks keyboard strokes race time', 'alex chatgpt working harmony counteract', 'hilariously unexpected twist alex', 'impending doom', 'computer whimsical carnival absurdity popup windows', 'endless parade dancing cats', 'surreal memes alex chatgpt', 'comedic battle order chaos mission save computer', 'laughterfilled adventure', 'mischievous virus sharing', 'jokes humorous banter', 'valiant efforts chatgpt alex', 'defeat virus computer screen', 'normal state', 'mischievous digital menace', 'alexs trusty', 'alex chatgpt', 'unbreakable bond', 'forever bonded laughter triumph', 'peculiar encounter', 'continued adventures', 'alex vast digital landscape armed wit knowledge', 'camaraderie tale chatgpt', 'alexs life', 'legend realm']"

2023-05-23 14:48:50,"Not ""free to use""","The app wants not only an SSO (or sign-in account), but also name, birth telephone number, and I don't know what else, because I stopped there - before the user has looked at the app itself. I had the impression this was free to use, with an option to pay for services, should the user decide the app suits the user's needs. What's actually happening is they're draining data from you the moment you want to have a look.

I have no problem providing data to a service provider (despite the egregiously bad, vendor-skewed terms of service common to tech ventures of all sorts (which really should be mauled in court by competent attorneys)), provided I want the service and feel there may be benefit in paying for a service. Asking for personal data for which the the service provider has no reasonable use is simply not acceptable.

This is new technology. It's not at all clear this app will be of any use to me. So why do you want my phone number, when you already have an SSO signing of on my contact information? When I have no relationship to you, as yet? No.

This is a poor way to start a relationship, and it is full of presumption and entitlement. You are not alone in this. But if you are releasing this app with the intent of building a user base, at least from where I sit (obviously, many people will rush into any commitment with a tech company without a second thought, and you can get by on those people if you like), this approach tells me you may be a problem rushing to develop. It would be better business practice to pretend, at least initially, you respect the people you want to use your products. Even Google did that, way back when.

2023-05-20 00:33:33,Title: Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Experience,"Review:
I regret to say that my experience with the ChatGPT app has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing. I had high hopes for an intelligent and helpful AI assistant, but this app fell far short of my expectations.

First and foremost, the app's performance was abysmal. The responses from ChatGPT were often nonsensical and lacked coherence. It frequently misunderstood my questions and provided irrelevant or inaccurate answers. This made any attempt at a meaningful conversation impossible, leaving me feeling more confused than before.

Furthermore, the app's usability was subpar at best. The interface was clunky and unintuitive, making it difficult to navigate and find the features I needed. It lacked basic functionalities that one would expect from a modern AI assistant app, such as the ability to save conversations or easily access previous interactions.

Even when it did manage to understand my queries, the responses often lacked depth and insight. ChatGPT seemed to provide generic, surface-level information without any real understanding or critical thinking. This severely limited its usefulness, especially when I sought detailed explanations or in-depth discussions.

In addition, the app's customer support was woefully inadequate. When I encountered issues or had questions about the app's functionality, I received generic and unhelpful responses. It was evident that the developers did not prioritize user satisfaction or promptly address user concerns.

Considering the high expectations and the potential of AI technology, the ChatGPT app failed to deliver a satisfactory experience. It was riddled with performance issues, lacked usability, and fell short in terms of providing meaningful and insightful interactions. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this app to anyone seeking a reliable and intelligent AI assistant.",1,review regret say experience chatgpt app incredibly frustrating disappointing high hopes intelligent helpful ai assistant app fell far short expectations first foremost apps performance abysmal responses chatgpt often nonsensical lacked coherence frequently misunderstood questions provided irrelevant inaccurate answers made attempt meaningful conversation impossible leaving feeling confused furthermore apps usability subpar best interface clunky unintuitive making difficult navigate find features needed lacked basic functionalities one would expect modern ai assistant app ability save conversations easily access previous interactions even manage understand queries responses often lacked depth insight chatgpt seemed provide generic surfacelevel information without real understanding critical thinking severely limited usefulness especially sought detailed explanations indepth discussions addition apps customer support woefully inadequate encountered issues questions apps functionality received generic unhelpful responses evident developers prioritize user satisfaction promptly address user concerns considering high expectations potential ai technology chatgpt app failed deliver satisfactory experience riddled performance issues lacked usability fell short terms providing meaningful insightful interactions regrettably recommend app anyone seeking reliable intelligent ai assistant,"['review regret', 'experience chatgpt app', 'intelligent helpful ai assistant app', 'far short expectations', 'first foremost apps', 'abysmal responses chatgpt often nonsensical lacked coherence', 'irrelevant inaccurate answers', 'meaningful conversation', 'furthermore apps usability subpar best interface', 'difficult navigate find features', 'basic functionalities', 'modern ai assistant app ability', 'previous interactions', 'understand queries responses', 'depth insight chatgpt', 'generic surfacelevel information', 'real understanding critical thinking', 'severely limited usefulness', 'detailed explanations indepth discussions addition apps customer support', 'woefully inadequate encountered issues questions apps functionality', 'generic unhelpful responses evident developers', 'user satisfaction', 'user concerns', 'high expectations potential', 'technology chatgpt app', 'satisfactory experience riddled performance issues', 'short terms', 'meaningful insightful interactions', 'app anyone']"

2023-06-23 18:57:51,Frustrating and Disappointing: A 1-Star Review for ChatGPT App,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of using the ChatGPT app, and I must say it was incredibly disappointing. From start to finish, the app failed to meet even the most basic expectations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied.

First and foremost, the app’s performance was subpar. It consistently struggled to understand and respond appropriately to my queries. The responses often seemed nonsensical, irrelevant, or simply lacked coherence. It felt like conversing with a bot that was trapped in a perpetual state of confusion.

Moreover, the app’s limited ability to handle context was a significant drawback. It frequently failed to maintain a coherent conversation thread, causing repeated misunderstandings and disjointed interactions. It lacked the ability to remember key details from previous exchanges, resulting in repetitive questions and disjointed replies that left me questioning its overall usefulness.

Another glaring issue was the app’s inability to grasp nuanced or complex queries. It often provided superficial and generic responses that felt like they were generated by a simplistic search engine rather than a sophisticated language model. It struggled with complex reasoning and failed to provide meaningful insights or deep understanding.

Furthermore, the app’s lack of empathy and emotional intelligence was highly evident. It failed to recognize and appropriately respond to emotional cues in the conversation. When expressing frustration or sadness, the app provided robotic and detached replies, further exacerbating my disappointment.

The app’s user interface also left much to be desired. It had a clunky design, with a convoluted menu structure that made navigation unnecessarily difficult. The overall user experience felt unintuitive and cumbersome, adding to the overall frustration of using the app.

Lastly, the lack of timely updates and improvements from the developers was disheartening. The app seemed stagnant, with no visible efforts to address the numerous flaws and enhance its capabilities. It gave the impression that customer feedback and satisfaction were low priorities.

In conclusion, the ChatGPT app was a thoroughly frustrating and disappointing experience.

首先，我要称赞它的智能和语言处理能力。它能够理解并回答复杂的问题，提供准确和详尽的回答。无论是技术性问题、文化知识还是实用建议，它总能给出令人满意的答案。

其次，这个应用非常易于使用。它的界面简洁明了，用户可以轻松提问并获得即时回复。对于那些需要快速解答问题或寻求帮助的人来说，这个应用是一个很好的选择。

此外，我还要提到它的适应能力。ChatGPT iOS应用可以根据用户的输入和反馈进行学习和改进，从而提供更加个性化和准确的回答。这种持续的学习使得它能够不断提升用户体验。

然而，正如所有的人工智能系统一样，它也有一些局限性。有时候，它可能会给出不完全准确或有误导性的答案。因此，在使用时我们仍然需要保持批判性思维，并结合其他信息进行判断。

总的来说，OpenAI的ChatGPT iOS应用是一个非常出色的工具。它能够为用户提供有用的信息和令人满意的回答，而且易于使用。它的智能和适应能力使得它成为一个强大的语言助手，可以帮助用户解决各种问题。",5,openai的chatgpt ios应用是一个非常强大和有用的工具它是一个基于人工智能的语言模型可以回答各种问题提供信息和与用户进行对话 首先我要称赞它的智能和语言处理能力它能够理解并回答复杂的问题提供准确和详尽的回答无论是技术性问题文化知识还是实用建议它总能给出令人满意的答案 其次这个应用非常易于使用它的界面简洁明了用户可以轻松提问并获得即时回复对于那些需要快速解答问题或寻求帮助的人来说这个应用是一个很好的选择 此外我还要提到它的适应能力chatgpt ios应用可以根据用户的输入和反馈进行学习和改进从而提供更加个性化和准确的回答这种持续的学习使得它能够不断提升用户体验 然而正如所有的人工智能系统一样它也有一些局限性有时候它可能会给出不完全准确或有误导性的答案因此在使用时我们仍然需要保持批判性思维并结合其他信息进行判断 总的来说openai的chatgpt ios应用是一个非常出色的工具它能够为用户提供有用的信息和令人满意的回答而且易于使用它的智能和适应能力使得它成为一个强大的语言助手可以帮助用户解决各种问题,"['首先我要称赞它的智能和语言处理能力它能够理解并回答复杂的问题提供准确和详尽的回答无论是技术性问题文化知识还是实用建议它总能给出令人满意的答案 其次这个应用非常易于使用它的界面简洁明了用户可以轻松提问并获得即时回复对于那些需要快速解答问题或寻求帮助的人来说这个应用是一个很好的选择 此外我还要提到它的适应能力chatgpt', '然而正如所有的人工智能系统一样它也有一些局限性有时候它可能会给出不完全准确或有误导性的答案因此在使用时我们仍然需要保持批判性思维并结合其他信息进行判断 总的来说openai的chatgpt ios应用是一个非常出色的工具它能够为用户提供有用的信息和令人满意的回答而且易于使用它的智能和适应能力使得它成为一个强大的语言助手可以帮助用户解决各种问题']"

2023-07-21 06:35:58,"Not very good, and a bit insulting for $20/mo","This app has potential, particularly when it comes to integration with shortcuts. However, as a tool for working with ChatGPT, especially for Plus users, it leaves much to be desired.

Most disappointingly, the app cannot use extensions unless the session is initiated from a web platform, and there's no option to edit your previous inputs for regeneration.

The inability to revise and resend your previous prompts severely limits the app's effectiveness for prompt development since there's no option for an edit/regenerate cycle. If you phrase something incorrectly and receive an odd response, there's no mechanism to rectify it. This renders the app more suitable for casual and simple interactions rather than anything more serious or intensive. 

There’s also a terrible design flaw that to copy or select text—the only way to export your results because OpenAI only implemented Share for the entire chat, and only to give you a useless URL you can post on Reddit—you have to pick that mode from a long press menu first. I’m not sure they were clear that in iOS, Share is the *only* real way to pass stuff between apps, and they just—skipped it. 

And then these rocket scientists put the “copy” and “select text” commands right by the “regenerate response” command. “Regenerate response” completely jettisons and replaces the prior text—with no confirmation.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve erased what I was trying to copy so I could save it. That also erases the whole downstream thread, and you have to risk that a bunch of times per thread if you want to export your response text because this is the only way to do it. Way to throw away my quota.

So this app is useless for the professional work I’m paying $20/mo for, but it’s just great for posting a chat full of parody song lyrics to Reddit. And that’s as far as OpenAI has thought about their costly service.

At home, there’s the severe issue that if you use the ChatGPT Conversation Shortcut from Siri on HomePod, there’s no way to end the conversation. They apparently only tested it on phones where you have buttons to push, and not on HomePod, where it all has to be done voice. Any command you try to give the HomePod to cancel the shortcut (Siri, stop) will be answered by ChatGPT (buzz off, I’m not Siri).

Worse, it’ll just listen forever, responding to any question within earshot, until it decides to time itself out if it doesn’t hear any words for a bit. If you thought Echo was bad about waking up and sending your conversation to Amazon by mistake, you ain’t seen nothing yet.  

Whoever designed this paid no attention to user experience, user privacy, or the Apple ecosystem, so I assume it was an intern project or something. I certainly hope they didn’t pay anyone for this because I’m pretty sad I’m paying them for this.  

OpenAI needs to step up their game if they’re going to sell access to end users for $20(!!!!!) a month. This app doesn’t cut it, and they should be at least a little ashamed it’s this mediocre after taking so long to develop it.",1,app potential particularly comes integration shortcuts however tool working chatgpt especially plus users leaves much desired disappointingly app use extensions unless session initiated web platform theres option edit previous inputs regeneration inability revise resend previous prompts severely limits apps effectiveness prompt development since theres option editregenerate cycle phrase something incorrectly receive odd response theres mechanism rectify renders app suitable casual simple interactions rather anything serious intensive theres also terrible design flaw copy select textthe way export results openai implemented share entire chat give useless url post reddityou pick mode long press menu first im sure clear ios share real way pass stuff apps justskipped rocket scientists put copy select text commands right regenerate response command regenerate response completely jettisons replaces prior textwith confirmation cant tell many times ive erased trying copy could save also erases whole downstream thread risk bunch times per thread want export response text way way throw away quota app useless professional work im paying 20mo great posting chat full parody song lyrics reddit thats far openai thought costly service home theres severe issue use chatgpt conversation shortcut siri homepod theres way end conversation apparently tested phones buttons push homepod done voice command try give homepod cancel shortcut siri stop answered chatgpt buzz im siri worse itll listen forever responding question within earshot decides time doesnt hear words bit thought echo bad waking sending conversation amazon mistake aint seen nothing yet whoever designed paid attention user experience user privacy apple ecosystem assume intern project something certainly hope didnt pay anyone im pretty sad im paying openai needs step game theyre going sell access end users 20 month app doesnt cut least little ashamed mediocre taking long develop,"['app potential', 'integration shortcuts however tool working chatgpt', 'much desired disappointingly app use extensions', 'web platform', 'option edit', 'previous inputs regeneration inability revise', 'previous prompts', 'apps effectiveness prompt development', 'option editregenerate cycle phrase', 'odd response', 'also terrible design flaw copy', 'export results openai', 'entire chat', 'useless url post', 'mode long press menu', 'stuff apps', 'rocket scientists', 'right regenerate response command regenerate response', 'textwith confirmation', 'many times', 'trying copy', 'whole downstream thread risk bunch times', 'quota app useless professional work', 'chatgpt conversation', 'siri homepod', 'way end conversation', 'homepod done voice command', 'homepod cancel shortcut siri stop', 'chatgpt buzz', 'earshot decides time', 'amazon mistake', 'paid attention user experience user privacy apple ecosystem', 'intern project something', 'openai needs step game', 'sell access', '20 month app', 'least little ashamed mediocre']"

It is very common for me to have to close the app, reopen it, open history, reopen the last conversation, and then ask the same question I asked before the app got stuck.

I used to wait for like 10 seconds before going through this. Now I've learned that if it takes more than three seconds to output anything, that likely won't change at 10 seconds, 20 seconds, etc.

Word to the wise: Respond to any delay that's not due to a poor signal by closing and reopening the app. Can't wait for this to change.

That said, AMAZING app for studying a new technology. Imagine the best professor you had in college (or best high school teacher) and then imagine being able to ask them as many probing questions as you want without feeling like you're being annoying or delaying the lecture.

2023-05-22 00:17:14,"Good, and can become Great","First, I really like the app and I’m now using it constantly. Thank you so much for making the app!

Now, for some ideas. I think the app could be way better if it facilitated various specific user stories: 
- as a GPT Plus user, I have many chats, it’s challenging to find stuff in them, so it’s really scattered, and I wish I could search my chat logs. 
- as someone who works with GPT on code projects, it would be incredible to have some integrated literate notebook programming features like runnable cells (maybe the plugins could help)
- as someone who pushes GPT to the limit, I often hit issues with context window, so it would be extremely useful if the interface simply drew a thick red line in the chat log at the start of the context window so we could see exactly what information will be available for the response. Perhaps that line would move depending on how long our messages are
- as someone who doesn’t have access to GPT4 on the API or Playground yet, I really feel like I can’t use GPT to the fullest extent, so I really wish I could set a system message and control various parameters like the playground makes available; it would be incredible if the system messages integrated ideas from Microsoft/guidance repo automatically, so we could write prompt templates with the handlebars syntax in the system message to guide the response formatting more clearly and efficiently 
- as an apple watch wearer, I would be thrilled to be able to send a message to chatgpt by talking to my watch, especially if it were integrated with a complication or the action button
- as an Apple customer, I can see how chatgpt integration with the Shortcuts app would potentially be revolutionary; we could enable routines with this; 
- as a prompt engineer, it feels like a lot of flipping back and forth between this app and 1Writer (great app btw) to manage the prompts and paste them around; it would be nice to have a prompt library both personal and public and perhaps make it easy to toggle prompts between private by default and public for others, especially if it had great version history; then when the prompts are updated everyone can use the latest version easily
- a close family member of mine uses an iPad Pro a ton, and as an iPad Pro user, they would really love it if there were a real iPad UI to use the big screen to the fullest and not have to use the janky scaled-up iPhone app (which is less fun and impressive than this app deserves to be)
- finally, as an AI user, I think it would be great if I could plug in my own data sources to a vector database and connect that to chatgpt without needing a third party; I’d love to chat with my Evernote, notion, Dropbox, drive, web history, messages, basically I wish I could index all my data and search it to pull relevant chunks for gpt if needed.

I’m sure there are more ideas, but imho, if you guys implemented these, you’d have a professional level app and it would be even more revolutionary than it already is!

2023-05-19 01:05:32,Less features than the web version,"There are less features than the web version of ChatGPT. (This review doesn’t speak for subscription versions.)

1. You cannot go back and edit prompts in a conversation. 
2. You cannot clear conversations.
3. Light/Dark theme is system based, there is no toggle.
4. No “Chat History & Training” Setting in the settings.
5. No examples/capabilities/limitations in the background of a new chat.

That’s all  the features not present on the mobile version that I could find.
Some features that are new or different are:

1. A “Haptic feedback” Setting
2. The box ChatGPT puts code, ascii, etc. is instead in a patch of tinted background.
3. Speech-to-Text.

Overall, not much is new/different. Some features from the web version are missing however. It’s ChatGPT however, so it gets 5 ⭐️. I would personally use the web version over the app as of now. This review doesn’t speak for the subscription features.

However, I believe there is scope for improvement to make this great app even better. Firstly, it would be immensely beneficial to add a browsing feature. This would enable users to quickly cross-reference information within the app, enriching the overall user experience.

Secondly, supporting plug-ins would greatly increase the app’s versatility. It would allow users to customize their experience and adapt the app to a wider range of applications.

Lastly, incorporating a code interpreter would be a game-changer. This feature could aid users in debugging code, learning new programming languages, or even automating tasks.
